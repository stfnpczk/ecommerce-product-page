## My process

### Built with

- mobile-first workflow
- Styled Components
- React
- Next.js

### What I learned

- lightbox modal with native dialog element
- image carousel slider with navigation functionality

### Continued development

In a further iteration, I'd like to optimize the carousel slider for mobile touch - either searching for a native solution or going with a library, like Swiper. An other aspect that I'd like to improve on, is the cart popover. Not quite happy with the polyfill of the Popover API yet, I opted for the MUI Popover component instead. With advancing browser compability, I'll look into it gain.
